"""edgeprint - offline WAF/CDN edge fingerprinting.

Analyzes HTTP responses that have already been captured to identify WAF, CDN and
edge-protection products, without sending any network traffic of its own. Built for
corpus-scale passive analysis: HAR exports, proxy logs, recon pipeline output.

Analyze only traffic you are authorized to possess. This tool reads files you give
it and makes no requests of its own; that does not make the capture itself lawful.
