## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed in review (second pass)

- **The HAR fixture was excluded by `.gitignore` (`*.har`) and never committed**, so
  the suite passed in the author's working tree and failed on a clean checkout with
  4 errors. Test fixtures are captures, not build artifacts, and are now exempt.
- **`verified_against` did not verify.** It asserted only that the named file
  existed, so 31 of 60 signals cited a capture they did not match — the dead
  fingerprint defect the rule exists to prevent. Signals are now replayed through
  the analyzer's own matchers, and block/challenge-page captures were added for
  every vendor that needed one.
- **Header case split repeated fields.** `_add_header` keyed on the raw name, so
  `Set-Cookie` and `set-cookie` became separate entries that normalisation later
  collapsed, reintroducing the overwrite it was written to prevent. HAR exports
  and proxy logs do not normalise case.
- **Body signals ignored their database weight** and never registered for layer
  promotion, so a body signal's `layer` override could not work.
- **Wildcard header signals lost their layer override**, because the observed
  header name was recorded where the fingerprint pattern was expected.
- **Overlapping block patterns each scored.** One page saying "request blocked",
  "access denied" and "forbidden" counted three times, letting generic phrasing
  outweigh real vendor evidence. The strongest match now scores once.
- **Verdicts thresholded display-rounded values**, so 0.596 rounded to 0.60 and
  crossed the bar. Thresholds use unrounded values; rounding is presentation only.
- **Confidence summed vendors below the naming threshold**, producing verdicts with
  an empty vendor list. Only named vendors contribute.
- `parse_json_obs` did not validate `body_excerpt`'s type, crashing on untrusted
  JSON. The 4096-byte cap was duplicated across three parsers and is now one
  constant.
- The Apache-2.0 SPDX marker stayed on the loader after the data moved; the data
  files now declare their own license and schema version, and the loader is marked
  MIT like the rest of the package.

### Added
- **Fingerprint database extracted from code into data.** Fingerprints live in
  `edgeprint/data/fingerprints/`, one plain JSON file per vendor, each signal
  carrying a weight, layer tag, provenance (`source`) and a required
  `verified_against` fixture path.
- Database validation runs in the test suite (`tests/test_fingerprints.py`), so
  `pytest` alone rejects the mistakes past bugs came from: generic block phrases
  used as vendor signals, cookie prefixes short enough to match opaque session
  values, and any signal without an existing fixture.
- `check.sh` runs tests, types, lint and format in one command, for working
  without CI.
- `docs/FINGERPRINT_SCHEMA.md` documents the format and the reasoning per rule.
- Per-signal weights are read from the database with type defaults as fallback, so
  replacing hand-assigned weights with measured likelihood ratios becomes a data
  change rather than a code change.

### Changed
- `edgeprint/fingerprints.py` is now a loader rather than the database itself;
  it exposes `FINGERPRINTS`, `SCHEMA_VERSION`, `load_vendor_files()`,
  `vendor_count()` and `signal_count()`.
- The database format is plain and language-neutral, and ships in the wheel, so
  other tools can consume it without depending on this package.

### Notes
- An earlier draft of this change authored the database as YAML and compiled it to
  JSON. The split bought inline comments at the cost of a build step, a dev
  dependency, a CI drift check and a class of source/artifact drift bugs — not a
  good trade at this size. JSON with a `notes` field carries the same information.
  Revisit if hand-authoring grows painful at scale.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-19

Renamed to **edgeprint** and repositioned from "offline WAF presence checker" to
passive edge fingerprinting over already-captured traffic.

### Fixed
- **Akamai was undetectable.** Fingerprints used exact header keys, so `x-akamai`
  never matched the real `x-akamai-transformed` / `x-akamai-request-id` headers.
  Prefix matching (`x-akamai*`) is now used where vendors suffix their headers.
- **False positives on unprotected origins.** Generic block phrases (`forbidden`,
  `access denied`, `request blocked`) scored as WAF evidence on stock nginx, Apache
  and IIS error pages. They now require an independent corroborating vendor signal.
- **Confidence saturated.** Scores were a raw sum of all indicator weights clamped
  to 1.0; a single vendor matching several signals reached the ceiling immediately.
  Each vendor's contribution is now capped.
- **Incorrect fingerprints.** `visid_incap` was listed as a header (it is a cookie);
  F5 `ts01`/`ts02` were arbitrary instances rather than real cookie patterns
  (BIG-IP ASM does set `TS<hex>` cookies, but `ts` is too short to use as a name
  prefix safely); replaced with `BIGipServer`, `MRHSession`, `LastMRH_Session`.
- Reports named the wildcard pattern (`x-akamai*`) instead of the header actually
  matched.
- Exit codes conflated "no WAF found" with "nothing analyzable"; a parsed response
  with no indicators now exits 0, and only an unusable observation exits 1.

### Fixed in review

Findings from the review of #5, all reproduced before fixing:

- **The block-page corroboration gate could be bypassed.** `request blocked` was
  listed as an Imperva and AWS body signal while also being a generic
  BLOCK_PATTERN, so the phrase corroborated itself: a plain nginx origin serving
  "Request Blocked" reached confidence 0.65 and exited 2. Corroboration now
  requires a vendor above the naming threshold, and generic phrases are no longer
  vendor signals.
- **Repeated headers were overwritten.** Only the last `Set-Cookie` survived, so
  the Imperva fixture's `incap_ses` cookie never matched and real Cloudflare
  responses lost one of `__cf_bm` / `cf_clearance`. Repeats are now joined.
- **The header/body boundary was guessed.** Blank lines were stripped and the
  boundary inferred from the first colon-free line, so a body containing CSS or a
  quoted header was parsed into the header map. The blank line per RFC 7230 is
  now the delimiter.
- **Cookie needles matched values, not names.** Short needles such as `_abck`
  fired on any opaque session value containing them. Cookie names are now parsed
  and matched as name prefixes.
- **`x-waf` was scored twice**, by both the F5 fingerprint and the generic hint,
  letting one header produce a verdict with no vendor named.
- **CDN was reported as WAF.** Fastly and CloudFront caching headers produced
  "WAF LIKELY PRESENT" and exit 2. Detection is now layered (`cdn` / `waf` /
  `bot`) with per-layer confidence, `likely_waf` separate from `likely_edge`, and
  a new exit code 3 for edge presence without WAF evidence.
- **Indicator values were lowercased**, so reported evidence was not verbatim.
- **Apache-2.0 was declared without shipping the license text.** `LICENSE-APACHE`
  and an SPDX header on the fingerprint module now back the claim.
- Tests ignored the manifest's `format` field; `cli.py` and `reporters.py` had no
  coverage at all. Coverage is now 87% with CLI exit codes asserted per fixture.

### Added
- Vendor coverage for AWS CloudFront/WAF and Fastly (8 vendors total).
- `tests/fixtures/` capture corpus with a manifest, covering every supported vendor
  plus negative cases. The test suite is generated from the manifest, and the
  manifest schema is shared with the planned lab and CNAME-labelled corpora.
- CI across Python 3.9-3.13: pytest, mypy, ruff, black.
- `NOTICE` recording upstream attribution, plus two deliberate exclusions:
  WhatWaf (GPL) and JA4S (FoxIO License 1.1).

### Changed
- Package `waf_presence_checker` -> `edgeprint`; command `wafpc` -> `edgeprint`.
- Fingerprint database will ship Apache-2.0; the engine stays MIT.
- README rewritten: roughly half the length, disclaimer bloat removed, honest
  comparison against wafw00f, and explicit limits.

### Known limitations
- HAR parsing still reads only the first entry. Multi-entry and streaming input
  arrive with the corpus-scale engine.
- Confidence weights remain hand-assigned rather than measured.
